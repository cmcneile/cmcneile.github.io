### Title

Recommendations for open automated reproducibility in computational
theoretical physics

### Abstract

As the volumes of data we work with and the number of analysis
techniques we deploy grow, it becomes increasingly important to manage
the reproducibility of our analysis workflows, so that others can
confidently build on our work. In this talk, after motivating why
openness and reproducibility are topics we need to care about, I will
outline some tools and techniques that can improve productivity when
working reproducibly, so that the process ultimately reduces rather
than increases the total workload.
