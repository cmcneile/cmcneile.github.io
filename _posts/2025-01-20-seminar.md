### Title

Dark Matter from SU (N) Containment

### Abstract

SU(N) Yang-Mills theories are known to undergo a first-order phase
transition. In this talk, I will show that the wall velocity is
bounded by $v_w < 10^{-6}$, constrained by the time required for the
substantial latent heat released during the transition to dissipate
via Hubble expansion. In our dark matter model, quarks much heavier
than the confinement scale can be introduced without affecting the
confinement dynamics. After freeze-out, these heavy quarks are trapped
in pockets of the deconfined phase until they annihilate with
antiquarks. I will present the surviving dark baryon abundance,
accounting for bound-state formation in both the bulk and—for the
first time—at the boundary. I will demonstrate that dark baryons can
serve as dark matter with masses up to $10^3$ TeV. Finally, I will
discuss potential indirect and direct detection signals, as well as
constraints from the cosmic microwave background and big bang
nucleosynthesis, assuming interactions through Higgs and neutrino
portals.
