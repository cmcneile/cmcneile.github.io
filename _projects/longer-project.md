## Overview

This research group studies how charged particles and light behave in intense
electromagnetic fields such as one would find in the most intense
laser pulses or in the very strong fields of magnetised neutron
stars. This research area is sometimes called `nonlinear' or
`strong-field' QED (quantum electrodynamics) and the main tool to
study it is quantum field theory.
