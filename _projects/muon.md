The exciting experimental measurement of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) from the Fermilab Muon g-2  experiment,
combined with the
earlier result from BNL, raises the hope of a measurable failure of the
standard model of particle physics.  However, a recent lattice QCD
calculation of the leading hadronic order hadronic correction to
$a_\mu$
amu
from the BMW collaboration found better agree with experiment,
thus motivating further improvements in the lattice QCD
calculations. McNeile has been working with the HPQCD, FNAL MILC
collaboration
